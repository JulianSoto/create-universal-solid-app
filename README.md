# Universal solid.js app

## Usage

Run `npm create universal-solid-app my-app` to initialize a new project inside `/my-app` (or the name of your choice).

## Routing

This is a minimal SSR setup, attempting to be as less opinionated as possible, so there's no support for file-system based routing. For this you'll have to use a router like `solid-router` (which is setup already in this template).

## Typescript support

Typescript is supported.
